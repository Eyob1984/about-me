                I started my professional career in the Air Force as a Visual Imagery & Intrusion Detction 
                Systems technician, or VIIDS for short. Working along side the video production team at 
                Lackland AFB, I became interested in video editing. After leaving the Air Force, I pursued 
                a Bachelor of Arts in Electronic Media at the Universityof Texas at El Paso. </br>
            </br>
                I started working at the local ABC station, KVIA, editing videos for air during the Good 
                Morning El Paso show. After which, I moved to Seattle & worked at KING for about a year. 
                Then, the recession of 2009, upended everything. </br>
            </br>
                I went back to my electronic technician background and began working at a remanufacturing
                company for automotice electronics, Instrument Sales & Service. It was there I got my first 
                taste of coding by teaching myself enough C#to create a small application for automatically 
                calibrating digital ratio adapter buffers (DRABs) for old pick-up trucks.</br>
            </br>
                Through a referral from a co-worker at Instrument Sales & Service, I was able to land a job 
                as a validation engineer at Zonar Systems. During my time there I was able to learn a great 
                deal from working with firmware developers & my fellow validation engineers. I was able to 
                teach myself a fair amount of SQL in order to parse and auto-generate daily reports in
                Google Studio.  </br>
            </br>
                Now, I am looking to take the experience I've gained over the past 2 decades and combine it
                with new skills learned at Code Fellows to accelerate my career forward.
